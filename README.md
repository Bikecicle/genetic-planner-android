# Genetic Planner

This is a personal project aimed at creating an app that will not only keep track of a schedule but plan out optimal times to complete tasks.

The planning aspect incorporates a genetic algorithm to allow for easy addition of complex or abstract directives. For instance, right now I have three directives implemented:
1. No overlaps (obviously)
2. Spread out tasks
3. Plan them for sooner rather than later

I have migrated from a console UI to Android, so for now, I am working out data storage and initial app design for testing. Next I plan on adding functionality aimed at using insights from the actual time spent on a task or delayed/missed tasks to better adjust planning based on individual habits.
